SmartX is a blockchain-based platform that aims to provide solutions for various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. The platform utilizes smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to facilitate secure and transparent transactions. SmartX also offers a range of services, including tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and asset management. The SmartX blockchain uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Believability (PoB) that aims to provide a more energy-efficient and scalable solution than traditional Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains.
